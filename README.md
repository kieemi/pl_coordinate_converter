## Plugin purpose## 

Plugin converts between geographical coordinates (DMS, DM, DD format) and two selected polish coordinate systems. It also allow to create a point from it in your current QGIS project. Some code of this app associated with geographical coordinates conversions is based on Udemy [QGIS plugin development with Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/qgis-plugin-development-with-python/) which i highly recommend for those who want to start create own QGIS plugins.

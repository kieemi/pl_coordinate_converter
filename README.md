Code of this app associated with geographical coordinates and conversions between DMS and DD formats is based on Udemy [QGIS plugin development with Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/qgis-plugin-development-with-python/) which i highly recommend for those who want to start create own QGIS plugins.

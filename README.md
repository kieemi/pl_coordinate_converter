## Plugin overview
The plugin opens in a single-window view, as depicted in the graphic attached below. Values dynamically change with each modification in any of the fields among the geographical DMS (1), DM (2), and DD (3) formats and the two selected Polish coordinate systems chosen in the comboboxes (4). Entered coordinates can also be added to the QGIS project as a point on a temporary layer (5), with its X and Y coordinates stored as attributes.

The code of this app, related to geographical coordinates and conversions between DMS and DD formats, is based on a course from Udemy. [QGIS plugin development with Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/qgis-plugin-development-with-python/) I highly recommend it for those who want to start creating their own QGIS plugins.
